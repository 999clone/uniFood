# University Food Ordering System

A simple database project for managing food orders in a university. Made with MySQL and DataGrip.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `create_tables.sql` â€“ creates all tables
- `insert_data.sql` â€“ sample data (users, foods, orders, etc.)
- `drop_tables.sql` â€“ deletes all tables

## ðŸ“Œ How it works

There are 6 main tables:
- `Departments`: list of university departments
- `Users`: students and teachers
- `Foods`: food items with prices
- `Menus`: daily menus
- `Menu_Items`: links foods to menus
- `Orders`: tracks who ordered what
